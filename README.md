## General Information
This project encompasses building a regression model to predict house prices in the Australian market for Surprise Housing, a US-based housing company expanding its operations. The company utilizes data analytics to purchase houses below market value and sell them at a profit. The dataset, collected from house sales in Australia, will be employed to develop a regression model using regularization techniques to predict house prices accurately.

### Business Problem
Surprise Housing aims to address the following queries:
- Identifying significant variables influencing house prices.
- Assessing the extent to which these variables affect house prices.
- Determining the optimal lambda values for ridge and lasso regression.

### Dataset
The dataset contains information on house sales in Australia and includes various independent variables that may impact house prices.

## Task
The tasks involved in this project are as follows:
- Task 1: Build a regression model using regularization techniques to predict house prices.
- Task 2: Identify significant variables affecting house prices and assess their impact on pricing dynamics.

## Technologies Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels

The project utilizes data analysis and modeling libraries in Python, including Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, Scikit-learn for machine learning models, and Statsmodels for statistical analysis.
